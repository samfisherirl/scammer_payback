# Allegation: Youtuber Scammer Payback is a fake. 
Skip to here for evidence, videos.  https://github.com/samfisherirl/scammer_payback/blob/main/README.md#evidence

## Preface

Scammer Payback is a Scam Vigilante, targeting Indian and Nigerian scammers who trick the elderly into transfering funds via social engineering and some tech savvy. 

He Livestreams, cropping to Yt videos. His biggest videos contain a set of events that are highly improbable, but seems to happen over and over in exactly the same way. 

I believe some of his interactions are genuine. There seems to be a template for a successful video on his channel, and that involves talking to the Scammer and the Victim. Somehow, it always magically happens, there are never major hiccups.  The victim always asks "how do you make money", and he gets to dunk on the victim with a promo for his channel. Then he cries about doing it for the people. 

Lastly, he has *The Minority Report* levels of hacking. He hacks into the scammers computers, which is fine. He also seemingly hacks into the victims phone, and their computer, with almost no delay or issues. 

## Key Reasons for Skepticism:

1. Claims to have taken down three call centers in India, which was reported in national news. However, the YouTuber isn't mentioned in the story, the narrative & timeline doesn't align, and there's no evidence backing his claims. This is just the first story I looked at.
2.  All significant videos follow the exact same path and have impossibly improbable outcomes. Indicators he has big events scripted, and those scripted events have actors. 
    - He always manages to talk to both the victim of the scam and the scammer.
    - The victim does not ask questions when he calls; the person getting scammed is always happy to hear from him. 
    - The victim always asks him something that segues into his self promo at the last arc of the story.

## Abstract contradictions 

1. Inflated Claims of Authority:
   - Alleges connections with the FBI, says they are on standby during calls. 
   - Claims the Nigerian Federal Police will conduct raids at his behest.
   - Simultainiously says local PD is ineffective. 


2. Contradictory Elements:
   - Mentions having the police "on standby" which seems implausible for an individual YouTuber.
   - Asserts possession of actionable intelligence yet fails to engage with authorities.


3. Unrealistic Scenario Depictions:
   - Describes overly smooth operations resembling scripted events, raising doubts about authenticity.
   - Utilizes promotional moments within calls that suggest prearranged outcomes.
 

4. Questionable Situational Awareness:
   - Staged hero moment looking into the camera, thus undermining the purported reality of the situation.
   - Victim behavior that contradicts common sense, e.g., a 77-year-old supposedly naive about scam practices yet knows how to uninstall apps.

### Reviewed video #2 :
- When he connects with a victim (I have spoken to people who were scammed, unrelated), people are always weary and always upset. Theyre being scammed at the time, and they wont trust anyone. Especially since the *Scammer* is calling usually from "Fraud Prevention". It becomes confusing fast. 
- Reporting to someone currently being scammed that they are talking to a scammer should almost never be a smooth intro but they always are for him. Like he's talking to someone he knows.

# General outline 

**Overview of Compelling Points Indicating the Video Might be Faked:**

1. **Inconsistent Police Collaboration Claims:**
   - Claims to have contacts in the FBI due to local police unresponsiveness.
   - Mentions having the Nigerian Federal Police ready to act on his command, yet also states he has no authority over the police.
   - Mention of police being on standby for a YouTuber, which raises questions about the authenticity of his claims.

2. **Contradictory Information:**
   - Claims to possess sufficient information for legal action but then does not pursue it with authorities.

3. **Scenario Execution Too Smooth:**
   - Describes scenarios that unfold too perfectly, akin to scripted radio show pranks, where the target always cooperates unnaturally.
   - Mentions of events being livestreamed with high-emotion moments looking directly into the camera, and subjects demonstrating unrealistic behavior.

4. **Unrealistic Interactions with Scammers:**
   - Discusses engaging in banter with scammers and describes scenarios that seem improbable (e.g., scammers staying on the line during exposure).
   
5. **Manipulative Emotional Appeals:**
   - Overuse of emotional appeals towards the end of videos.
   - Descriptions implying that victims act naive or overly emotional, which seems crafted for narrative impact rather than a genuine portrayal.

6. **Doubtful Technical Descriptions:**
   - Vague on the technical methods employed for tracking and confronting scammers.
   - Relies on simple tools like Notepad for processes that would typically require more sophisticated approaches.

7. **Too Perfect Situation Resolutions:**
   - Each video reportedly ends in a "soy moment," suggesting an ideal, perhaps unrealistic, resolution every time.

8. **Suspicious Victim Behavior:**
   - Victims in the videos sometimes immediately claim they've not given out information without proper questioning.

9. **Questionable Law Enforcement Relationships:**
   - Suggests he can direct both local and international law enforcement actions, which is highly unlikely for an individual, especially a YouTuber.

**Overall Context:**
The skepticism arises from various inconsistencies and overly dramatic elements that align more with entertainment rather than genuine scam busting operations. These include unrealistic cooperation from all parties involved, improbably smooth operations, contradictory claims about law enforcement interactions, and scenarios that seem tailored to evoke emotional responses or promote the channel more than deliver authentic content.
