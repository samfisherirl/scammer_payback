# Allegation: Youtuber Scammer Payback is a fake. 
Skip to here for evidence, videos.  https://github.com/samfisherirl/scammer_payback/blob/main/README.md#evidence

## Preface

Scammer Payback is a Scam Vigilante, targeting Indian and Nigerian scammers who trick the elderly into transferring funds via social engineering and tech savvy tactics.

He livestreams, cropping to YouTube videos. His biggest videos contain a sequence of events that are highly improbable but seem to happen repeatedly in the exact same way.

Some of his interactions appear genuine. There seems to be a template for successful videos on his channel involving conversations with the scammer and victim. It always magically unfolds without major hiccups. The victim consistently asks, "How do you make money?" allowing him to promote his channel. Then, he emotionally expresses doing it for the people.

Additionally, he displays hacking skills akin to *The Minority Report*. He infiltrates scammers' computers seamlessly. Moreover, he seemingly accesses victims' phones and computers with minimal delay or issues.

### Key Reasons for Skepticism:
Claims to have taken down three call centers in India, as reported in national news. However, his absence in the story, discrepancies in the narrative and timeline, and lack of evidence undermine his claims.

All significant videos follow the same path with implausibly improbable outcomes. There are indications that significant events are scripted with actors.
He consistently converses with both scam victims and scammers.
Victims do not question him during calls; they seem elated to hear from him.
Victims often ask leading questions that seamlessly lead to his self-promotion at the climax of the narrative.

Abstract contradictions and inflated claims of authority:
- Alleges connections with the FBI, suggesting they are on standby during calls.
- Claims to have the Nigerian Federal Police conduct raids at his request, while critiquing local law enforcement.
Contradictory elements:
- Mentions having the police "on standby," seeming implausible for an individual YouTuber.
- Asserts possession of actionable intelligence yet fails to engage with authorities.

Unrealistic scenario depictions:
- Describes overly smooth operations resembling scripted events, casting doubts on authenticity.
- Incorporates promotional moments within calls, implying prearranged outcomes.

Questionable situational awareness:
- Stages hero moments by looking into the camera, undermining the supposed reality of the situation.
- Depicts victim behavior that contradicts common sense, such as a supposedly naive 77-year-old knowing how to uninstall apps.

### Reviewed video #2 :
- When he connects with a victim (I have spoken to people who were scammed, unrelated), people are always weary and always upset. Theyre being scammed at the time, and they wont trust anyone. Especially since the *Scammer* is calling usually from "Fraud Prevention". It becomes confusing fast. 
- Reporting to someone currently being scammed that they are talking to a scammer should almost never be a smooth intro but they always are for him. Like he's talking to someone he knows.

- Claims of having FBI contacts: https://youtu.be/_3RBNNbMhqs?t=467

# General outline 

**Overview of Compelling Points Indicating the Video Might be Faked:**

1. **Inconsistent Police Collaboration Claims:**
   - Claims to have contacts in the FBI due to local police unresponsiveness.
   - Mentions having the Nigerian Federal Police ready to act on his command, yet also states he has no authority over the police.
   - Mention of police being on standby for a YouTuber, which raises questions about the authenticity of his claims.

2. **Contradictory Information:**
   - Claims to possess sufficient information for legal action but then does not pursue it with authorities.

3. **Scenario Execution Too Smooth:**
   - Describes scenarios that unfold too perfectly, akin to scripted radio show pranks, where the target always cooperates unnaturally.
   - Mentions of events being livestreamed with high-emotion moments looking directly into the camera, and subjects demonstrating unrealistic behavior.

4. **Unrealistic Interactions with Scammers:**
   - Discusses engaging in banter with scammers and describes scenarios that seem improbable (e.g., scammers staying on the line during exposure).
   
5. **Manipulative Emotional Appeals:**
   - Overuse of emotional appeals towards the end of videos.
   - Descriptions implying that victims act naive or overly emotional, which seems crafted for narrative impact rather than a genuine portrayal.

6. **Doubtful Technical Descriptions:**
   - Vague on the technical methods employed for tracking and confronting scammers.
   - Relies on simple tools like Notepad for processes that would typically require more sophisticated approaches.

7. **Too Perfect Situation Resolutions:**
   - Each video reportedly ends in a "soy moment," suggesting an ideal, perhaps unrealistic, resolution every time.

8. **Suspicious Victim Behavior:**
   - Victims in the videos sometimes immediately claim they've not given out information without proper questioning.

9. **Questionable Law Enforcement Relationships:**
   - Suggests he can direct both local and international law enforcement actions, which is highly unlikely for an individual, especially a YouTuber.

**Overall Context:**
The skepticism arises from various inconsistencies and overly dramatic elements that align more with entertainment rather than genuine scam busting operations. These include unrealistic cooperation from all parties involved, improbably smooth operations, contradictory claims about law enforcement interactions, and scenarios that seem tailored to evoke emotional responses or promote the channel more than deliver authentic content.
