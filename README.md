# Allegations; Scammer Payback is fake. 
### Key Reasons for Skepticism:

1. Inflated Claims of Authority:
   - Alleges connections with the FBI, says they are on standby during calls. 
   - Claims the Nigerian Federal Police will conduct raids at his behest.
   - Simultainiously says local PD is ineffective. 


2. Contradictory Elements:
   - Mentions having the police "on standby" which seems implausible for an individual YouTuber.
   - Asserts possession of actionable intelligence yet fails to engage with authorities.


3. Unrealistic Scenario Depictions:
   - Describes overly smooth operations resembling scripted events, raising doubts about authenticity.
   - Utilizes promotional moments within calls that suggest prearranged outcomes.
 

4. Questionable Situational Awareness:
   - Staged hero moment looking into the camera, thus undermining the purported reality of the situation.
   - Victim behavior that contradicts common sense, e.g., a 77-year-old supposedly naive about scam practices yet knows how to uninstall apps.

# General outline 

**Overview of Compelling Points Indicating the Video Might be Faked:**

1. **Inconsistent Police Collaboration Claims:**
   - Claims to have contacts in the FBI due to local police unresponsiveness.
   - Mentions having the Nigerian Federal Police ready to act on his command, yet also states he has no authority over the police.
   - Mention of police being on standby for a YouTuber, which raises questions about the authenticity of his claims.

2. **Contradictory Information:**
   - Claims to possess sufficient information for legal action but then does not pursue it with authorities.

3. **Scenario Execution Too Smooth:**
   - Describes scenarios that unfold too perfectly, akin to scripted radio show pranks, where the target always cooperates unnaturally.
   - Mentions of events being livestreamed with high-emotion moments looking directly into the camera, and subjects demonstrating unrealistic behavior.

4. **Unrealistic Interactions with Scammers:**
   - Discusses engaging in banter with scammers and describes scenarios that seem improbable (e.g., scammers staying on the line during exposure).
   
5. **Manipulative Emotional Appeals:**
   - Overuse of emotional appeals towards the end of videos.
   - Descriptions implying that victims act naive or overly emotional, which seems crafted for narrative impact rather than a genuine portrayal.

6. **Doubtful Technical Descriptions:**
   - Vague on the technical methods employed for tracking and confronting scammers.
   - Relies on simple tools like Notepad for processes that would typically require more sophisticated approaches.

7. **Too Perfect Situation Resolutions:**
   - Each video reportedly ends in a "soy moment," suggesting an ideal, perhaps unrealistic, resolution every time.

8. **Suspicious Victim Behavior:**
   - Victims in the videos sometimes immediately claim they've not given out information without proper questioning.

9. **Questionable Law Enforcement Relationships:**
   - Suggests he can direct both local and international law enforcement actions, which is highly unlikely for an individual, especially a YouTuber.

**Overall Context:**
The skepticism arises from various inconsistencies and overly dramatic elements that align more with entertainment rather than genuine scam busting operations. These include unrealistic cooperation from all parties involved, improbably smooth operations, contradictory claims about law enforcement interactions, and scenarios that seem tailored to evoke emotional responses or promote the channel more than deliver authentic content.
